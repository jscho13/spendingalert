Top 6 reasons why we spend so much each month
Jim Butler · May 12, 2017 ·

There are countless reasons for overspending but below I listed my top 6:

The use of debit and credit cards and not cash doesn’t allow us to feel the pain. Just swipe!
Spending from several different credit cards and debit card makes it hard to keep track.
Credit card and checking statements billing cycles do not start and stop on the calendar month but on the day you signed up with them so it makes reviewing monthly spending more confusing.
Complete lack of awareness to how much we have actually spent so far on any given day in the month.
Wanting stuff that in 2 weeks we don’t even care about that much.
Arguing about money in your relationship.  One person always has to be the bad guy saying we are spending to much which results in arguments. SpendingAlert will allow you to set a monthly spending limit goal together and the app is the bad guy telling each other to slow down your spending and not you!
