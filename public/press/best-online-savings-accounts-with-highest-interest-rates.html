Best Online Savings Accounts with the Highest Interest Rates
Jim Butler · Jun 20, 2017 ·

One day I realized my local bank was giving me the absolute lowest interest rates on my saving’s account. I accepted their .20 % rate for a long time without doing anything about it.  That time ended when I did a little research and found out there are plenty of online banks that offer much higher yields on savings accounts and they are FDIC insured up to $250,000. Plus having a savings account that is seperate from your local bank so can you automatically save money each month is an important step to financial freedom.

I found a handful of online banks with much higher interest rates and I learned a few things in the process.

Check their ratings on Google and other websites to make sure they are a good bank. Also rates do change so check back here or at the website of the bank that you are comparing to make sure you are getting the best interest rates. Personally I opened up 2 accounts at different online banks and move the money around if one of the banks significantly reduces or increases their rates.  Furthermore make sure there aren’t any special restrictions such as min balances to receive the advertised rate. This is an easy thing to do because you do not have to leave your bank. Keep your current checking account and sign up for an online high yield savings account as well.  Then link the accounts together so you can automatically fund your online savings account each month with whatever you can afford.  Please comment if you have other banks that you recommend. Below are a list of the banks that I follow. It is very important to always confirm that the bank you end up choosing is FDIC Insured. FDIC Lookup
