Money Saving Tips

The best way to save money: Signup for a savings account that is at a different bank then your checking account. Then setup an automatic savings transfer (for example $500) that goes into that savings account each month.  This automatic approach is a great way to save but you still need to be aware of your spending so you have enough money in the account each month to actually save.
Become more aware of how much you spend every month in real-time (meaning having a way to add up all the accounts you spend from each month easily).
Once a year go through all reoccurring expenses (cable, cell phone, etc. and negotiate for a lower rate or leave the company and find a lower rate.)
Increase the interest rate you are receiving on your savings account. Most online banks offer a savings rate 30 times what large banks offer. But make sure they are legitimate banks and are FDIC insured.
Compare up to 4 vendors pricing anytime you need to have work done for your home or business to make sure you are not getting ripped off.
When traveling compare many websites and then ultimately call the hotel itself to see if they can beat the online rates.
Seems obvious but make more money! The internet has endless opportunities for earning money while you still maintain your full time job.
